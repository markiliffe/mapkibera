            Our security map, featuring data points collected by our 9 intrepid Kiberan mappers over two days, has proved to be an incredible start to a conversation about the security risks faced by young women in particular in Kibera as well as the population in general. Here are a few notes from conversations we've had with girls (age 18-24) who belong to Binti Pamoja, a young women's group in the Olympic village, and with security decision makers in Soweto West.

                Behavior:
                ·      The girls that can afford it go out to clubs in town like Tacos on the weekends. They take a matatu and go from 9PM to 5AM.  They stay out until dawn because it becomes safer to travel home
                ·      Many young girls who can’t afford to go to town dance at nightly funeral parties. They are highly at risk of violence.
                ·      Can’t go out at night past 11PM in Kibera. Even though the markets near the Adopt-a-lights are open all night, it is still quite dangerous.
                Locations:
                ·      Specific unsafe areas: entire length of railroad, Kibera drive starting at bridge to Gatwikera, roads leading into Gatwikera from Kibera Road
                ·      Pointed out where their friends have experienced violence, provided a big picture overview of crime trends and the elements tied to them.

                The girls seemed very relaxed and hands on, I think that's due to the fact, that they act as  leaders of the activities that are taking place in safe houses.
                They located all the safe houses from the list. Locations are not exact. They sad that they couldn't locate them precisely because there were to few points on the map, trough which they could orientate.
                At the beginning of the session we asked each of the grils where they feel safest. Answers were different: home, church, Binti Pamoja, Carolina for Kibera. Each of them gave us reasons why they feel safe. On the emotional side it seems, that they feel safest when they are with their family and friends that share the same interest's,  in a more psychical way they feel safe in compound – fenced places.
                The other important thing that they talked about is the importance of knowing safe corners (as they call them).  They said that its good to know the villages where you move the most, because you get to know which compounds are safe for hiding.  This is specially important for people that live in villages that are far from matatu stands.
                During the weekends they go out in the centre of the city because its more safe. They said that they need to be home by 21.00. Children in primary school need to be home at 18.00. 
                Girls said that the most dangerous village in Kibera is Gatwekera.  According to them the most muggings, prostitution, rapes and drug use happens in this village. They kind of blame the amount of local brew that's available in the village. People go there, get drunk with bukassa and when they leave the bar they get robbed – they can't defend themselves because they are too drunk. They also say that the most drugs are available in Gatwekera. The most common drug according to them is bang. Locations of casual sex are spread throughout Kibera. It's a boys responsibility to hire a room in a lodge, where they can have sex. Bars and lodges usually sell condoms. 
                They say that the dam is very dangerous because there is a certain grass growing there and young kids think its just like any other playing ground. When they go there, they drown.
                As to the places where you can fall or get hurt because there are holes and similar things the girls said, that they know every stone in Kibera, hence its imposible to get hurt.
                On the other hand they talked about how the whole railway line is dangerous, because there is no lights there.
                They also said that more robberies occur during rains, because of the metal roofs its really loud  when it rains and you cant really hear if someone is robbing in the next house.
                They said that the police doesnt help a lot, becuse most of them are bad!
                When I asked if there are safe houses for boys, they only mantioned Carolina for Kibera as having football teams.
                One more observation that I found is that this group of girls is highly motivated and they have certain kind of attitude. Different from the mappers, they are louder, more aggresive when they talk, but on the other hand it seems that they have certain standards when it comes to, how someone should behave.... I am wandering how many good friends they have among girls that are not involved with Binti Pamoja and safe houses. One girl in the whole gorup took a leading role, talking the most.  They didnt mind presence of Primož, even when we were talking about sex, contraception,  homosexuality etc.....it was so interesting how they kept on saying that they are open and that they don't mind presence of men.

                Mikel/Josh
                Policy: 
                · <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/browse/node/30694169">Kilimani</a>
                is closest police station, over 5KM (?) away from Kibera. Need a police station for emergency services. One suggestion is to locate on Kibera Road just adjacent to <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/browse/way/48203979">large church</a>.
                ·      Need rehabilitation centers, drug use is a direct input into crime but there is only one drug rehabilitiation center (<a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/browse/node/612007614">SAPTA</a>) and its in Olympic, informal areas don’t know about it and they don’t do much outreach
                ·      Police don’t have a community engagement strategy. Need sensitization to realities of what is happening in communities.
                ·      Community policing play an important role through collecting intelligence on crime but they do not have locations within the informal areas because they would be a target of crime. Rather they are based at the DC's camp.
                ·      Lights without police are ineffective because they only encourage commerce at night without encouraging safety
                Geo: 
                ·      Most carjacking (and matatu jacking) happens just after <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/browse/way/48161277">bridge to Ayany</a>, while <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/browse/way/48161140">border between Ayany and Kianda</a>
                is known for prostitution 
                ·      Most dangerous areas are those that are close to natural cover, such as <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/browse/way/25737868">forest at end of Anany</a>
                as well as area in Silanga near <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/browse/way/25739092">Nairobi dam</a>, these areas are dangerous even in the day because of high reeds and forest cover. These areas are dangerous even during the day. 
                ·      Mugging is known to take place in formal areas, particularly on pay day, since these are entry points into Kibera with goods and funds. Also early in the day when shopkeepers and business people may be going out to get stock. Specifically note <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/browse/way/48161192">Makina starting at stage</a>
                and <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/browse/way/48161335">Karanja Road starting at stage</a>, particularly road leading from <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/browse/way/48161463">Kibera Women Network Resource Center down to railroad</a>. The <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/browse/way/48161141">road</a>
                leading from Olympic Stage, past the <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/browse/node/612006932">Chief's Camp</a>
                is one exception. 
                * Even the <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/browse/node/612007282">Makina Mosque</a>
                area is known to be dangerous 
                * <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/browse/node/612009202">Sky Villa Bar</a>
                is known as popular, new joint, where people with money come to have fun ... so is a target 
                · <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/browse/way/48161262">Gatwekera</a>
                has a particularly low crime rate (?) because there are fierce defenders of public safety in the local community 
                . The <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/browse/node/612010557">political open ground below Olympic</a>
                (name?) used to be known as very dangerous, until the public demolished kiosks in which criminals used to hide.
                * Chief's camps at Laini Saba ground, and across the railroad track, need to be added to be map.
                General:
                ·      Mobile phones make criminal coordination easler. Police patrols can be avoided easily.
                ·      Much crime takes place in formal areas because this is where people come with money. However, most criminals live in informal areas. A crime displacement theory notes that people don’t commit crimes in areas where they live
                ·      There are many weapons within the informal areas, but not needed anymore, with discourage police incursions. Burglers can use gas and powder to make people fall asleep before they get robbed 
                ·

                Anusa: The girls were a bit shy at the begenning, but after a while started talking. They were mostly talking about lack of security in other  villages, not their own. As the most dangerous spots they specificaly mentioned the dam (bodies of raped victioms are thrown in the dam) and railway. They mentioned that you can find Maasai man around business areas and if you pay them 30-40 shillings they escort you home. They also talked about connection between  education and saftey. Girls that drop out of school have a big chance of ending up as prostitutes, which means they are more exposed to HIV, STDs, rapists... Boys that drop out of school have a big chance of edning up in a gang. They mantioned, that there is a man called Sailant man in Makina. He watches out for robbers. If he sees them he warns them never to come back again, if they do, he apparently kills them.
